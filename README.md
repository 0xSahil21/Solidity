Welcome to my first ever Solidity repository!
This project marks the beginning of my journey into Web3 smart contract development using the Foundry Framework.

Introduction
This repository is a work-in-progress collection of smart contracts, written as I learn, experiment, and explore the capabilities of the Ethereum ecosystem through Solidity. 

Features
Beginner-Friendly: All code is crafted with clarity, commenting, and simplicity in mind.
Powered by Foundry: Leveraging the Foundry toolchain for a modern, efficient workflow.
Tested Code: Includes unit tests to ensure correctness as I learn.
Open to Contributions: Suggestions, code reviews, and pull requests are warmly welcomed!
